# The Question (1)

* Even though the Parti Conservateur du Québec (PCQ) did not succeed in electing any members to the Assemblée Nationale in the October 2022 provincial election in Quebec, the party nonetheless won 12.9% of the popular vote, up from 1% in the 2018 election:  

* During the electoral campaign, the PCQ (and its leader, Éric Duhaime) attracted considerable media attention. The party campaigned on topics **associated with the economic right** (with a clear agenda of state reduction) as well as dissatisfaction with the Legault government, particularly its **COVID-19 health measure.**

*  The question remains as to which of these issue dimensions drove support for the PCQ the most:

# The data

* Using individual-level survey data from the Quebec Election Study, we assess the degree to which these various factors explaining support, in addition to leader evaluation, explain PCQ vote choice in the 2022 Provincial election.

* Panel data (Pre-election and post-election)
  * Very little **attrition**:

```{r, include = T}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(CPS = ifelse(!is.na(cps_weight_general), "CPS: Responded", NA),
         PES = ifelse(!is.na(pes_weight_general), "PES: Responded", "PES: Did Not Respond"))
```

```{r, include = T}
datasummary_crosstab(CPS ~ PES, statistic = ~ N + Percent() + 1, data = df, title = "Attrition, 2022 Quebec Election Study")
```

* The questionnaire was available in **French** or **English**
